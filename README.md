# Modern

This is the _"Modern"_ theme I currently use on [nick.groenen.me].

It is a fork of the [Hello Friend] theme by [panr].

## CSS changes

Changes to CSS should be done in `assets/postcss/*`.

While making changes, you'll want to have postcss running:

```
yarn run postcss

# Or with npm:
npm run postcss
```

## Licence

This theme is provided under the [MIT] license.
