# Modern

This is the _"Modern"_ theme I currently use on [blog.fetinin.dev].

It is a fork of the https://github.com/zoni/hugo-theme-modern which is a fork of [Hello Friend] theme by [panr].

## CSS changes

Changes to CSS should be done in `assets/postcss/*`.

While making changes, you'll want to have postcss running:

```
npm run postcss
```
